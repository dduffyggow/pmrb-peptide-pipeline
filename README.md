# pmrb-peptide-pipeline
Computational pipeline for modelling interactions between de novo random peptides (DCRs/ARPs) and the PmrB sensor kinase, including AlphaFold/ColabFold structure prediction, AutoDock Vina docking, and GROMACS molecular dynamics, developed for an MSci dissertation (University of Glasgow, 2026).
